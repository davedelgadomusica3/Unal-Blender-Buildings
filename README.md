# Unal-Blender-Buildings
Iniciative to produce some models of the main buildings of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia from zero to use them in projects of different kinds (Mainly for educational purposes)

Initially we have 4 models created from scratch in order to use them in a videogame whose enviroment its inspired by the University Campus mianly in the central square. these models are:

-Biblioteca Central
-Torre de Enfermeria
-Auditorio Leon De Greiff
-Edificio de registro y perola

The quality of the buildings is basic since they were only assets in our videogame but still they are pretty good to start :)
You can download the buildings and use them in your projects and also contribute with new models of other buildings of the university or with enhances to the current buildings
